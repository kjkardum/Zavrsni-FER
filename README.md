# Zavrsni rad

## Theme

This work focuses on studying, understanding, and implementing create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations through a development framework for single-page web-applications (SPAs). A prototype development framework was created that enables quick and straightforward development of SPA applications that implement CRUD operations. The testing of the prototype was carried out on a simple API created for testing purposes. Although there is room for improvement and expansion, this work provides a foundation for understanding and developing development frameworks for single-page CRUD web-applications.
